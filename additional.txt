- Describe (no need to code) how you can secure this endpoint using Spring Security using Oauth2 in a file and include the text file in the root of the project
We can use spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client to protect the endpoints. There is a document attached Oauth2Example

- Describe how you can document this API for consumers of the API
There are many but I have used Apiary and Swagger. I have migrated  Apiary  to  swagger as it is annotation based, easy to use and dynamic to accommodate end points changes. There are many options for customization however need a separate server for endpoint  access for end users. 
- Describe any design pattern you have leveraged in your solution.
There are many spring design pattern used including IOC, Singleton and used repository, service layer. followed best practices including SOLID over STUPID.
